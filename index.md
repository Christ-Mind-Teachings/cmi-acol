## Welcome to A Course Of Love
{: .ui.header}

A Course of Love is a book that changes lives because its purpose is to return you to your true Self. That one change will completely change your life and the world. Forty years ago Jesus dictated ACIM to the scribe Helen Schucman. More recently, over three years, he similarly dictated A Course of Love to Mari Perron. Students of ACIM will recognize the Voice. Jesus describes ACOL as a “continuation” of A Course in Miracles. Students of truth, whatever their background, will find that ACOL resonates with the heart. ACOL is often experienced as more of a transmission than a text. It keeps on revealing more, even to those who have read it numerous times before. Many readers find it to be truly alive.
