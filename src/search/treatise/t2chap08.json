    "text": " it was said often within a course of love that the truth does not change thus the truth of who you are has not changed and you are as you were created form and behavior are however subject to change as are your expressions of who you are this distinction must be fully realized here in order for you to accept the truth of who you are and to come to an acceptance of the unchangeable nature of this truth this is akin to being done with seeking this is the final acceptance that you have found and that you have been found you need no longer journey onto the paths of seeking the truth of yourself that you reveal now will not become a new truth as you take a new path your path now is sure and its final acceptance necessary you are the prodigal sons and daughters who have returned home your stay is not finite you are not here to rest and gain strength for another journey in search of something that is not available here here is the realm of the already accomplished this is home your expression of who you are may lead you to many new adventures but never again to the special relationships that would take you away from your true self never again will you be away from home for home is who you are a place you carry within you a place that is you this is the home of unity "
