    "text": " you are all aware at least at times that there are treasures that lie within you what was once regarded as treasure such as a talent that was in need of developing when realized is often disregarded thereafter as a treasure and becomes instead something regarded as an ability and later as simply part of your identity this is what we are going to explore in this treatise a treasure that you do not as yet recognize is going to be recognized once recognized it will begin to be regarded as an ability and finally through experience it will become your identity we will begin by discussing the nature of treasure"

    "text": " those of you who have moved beyond the realm of the ego in your fear of returning to it often turn away from internal treasures that you believe when realized might feed the ego despite many observations within this course regarding desire you may still fear your desire despite many exhortations that your purpose here is to be who you are you may have determined that exploring your internal treasure is now unnecessary you may well be feeling a sense of relief in having learned that who you are right now is a being of perfection and you may find in this a somewhat peaceful resting place to dwell in for a time you may find that despite having learned much about the need to leave judgment behind you judge your desire to be other than you are now including any desires related to those internal treasures you had once hoped to have become abilities you think this willingness to accept who you are now is what this course has led you to and evidence of your accomplishment you may view this as license to stay as you are and to cease striving for more "
