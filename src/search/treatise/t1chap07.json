    "text": " even the most spiritual and godly among you accept suffering even those who understand as completely as possible the truth of who they are accept suffering my use of the word accept is important here as these may not see suffering as pain but only as a natural part of being human that calls for acceptance they thus find peace within suffering rather than abolishing suffering this acceptance is due to the belief that spirit has chosen a form and more accurately put a lesser form in which to exist and that that choice includes the choice to suffer this belief may accept suffering as a learning device rather than a punishment but it still in its acceptance of a false notion invites suffering this belief accepts learning through contrast that evil is seen in relation to good peace in relation to chaos love in relation to fear this belief exists in the in between where on the one hand there is darkness and on the other hand there is light one or the other must exist at a given time but never both thus the absence of good health is disease the absence of peace is conflict the absence of truth illusion this belief does not accept that there is only one reality and that it must exist where you are "
