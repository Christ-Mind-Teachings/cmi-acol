    "text": " the death of the ego thought system has made way for the birth of the thought system of the truth the thought system of the ego was based on fear in this time of translation from one thought system to the other the most subtle and yet significant change is the change from the foundation of fear the basis of the ego thought system to a foundation of love the basis of the thought system of truth while the foundation of fear like the ego will have left you now a pattern of behaving fearfully may still remain and as such be a deterrent to new ideas and to action as long as these patterns of fear remain as deterrents to action you will not experience the freedom of living from the new thought system the new thought system will still exist within your mind and heart as nothing can now take this memory from you but to experience the new thought system as thought alone will not bring about the changes you would so desire to have come about within your physical experience you may live a more peaceful and meaningful life but you will not become the savior i ask you to be or the architects of the new world of heaven on earth that i call you to create "

    "text": " let me attempt to make the difference between having a new thought system and living by a new thought system more clear because you now are translating the thought system of the ego into the thought system of the truth you will begin to believe in such things as benevolence and abundance what this means is that you will slowly translate all ideas of scarcity into ideas of abundance all ideas of blame into ideas of benevolence thus you might after this period of translation rather than cursing your station in life and feeling badly that you do not enjoy the health wealth or stature of some others accept your current status and begin to feel more peace and joy within it if you are not well you may cope more easily with your discomfort if you are not financially secure you may congratulate yourself on desiring less and be more content living a simple life if you have felt a lack of respect you may feel that what others think of you matters not and enjoy a heightened self concept while these would all be worthy aims they are not the goal toward which we work these would be the consequences of new beliefs that are held but not lived soon these fragile states would be sure to feel threatened by some situation or person and judgment would return to label what is happening as bad a god outside of the self would soon be called upon to intercede blame would be placed a return to equanimity would soon prevail for those dwelling in the house of truth would not long abide with such illusions but the pattern of the old would not be broken suffering and strife would still seem to be possible you would merely look back after the interlude had passed and see the truth realizing that a lesson had been learned and becoming aware that for a while you but flirted with illusion this flirting with illusion is like unto the temptations of the human experience and would not occur were the temptations gone from you "
