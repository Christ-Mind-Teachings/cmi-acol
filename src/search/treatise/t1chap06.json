    "text": " to use prayer only as a means of reaching out to a god seen as separate is to attempt to use what cannot be used such ideas of prayer have had credence because this reaching out does at least recognize that there is something to reach out to such ideas of prayer have long been opening doors for those who are ready to walk through them to a real relationship with god and self but this is not the concept of prayer of which we speak nor one that can reasonably be called a way of life or likened to the art of thought prayers such as these emanate from either heart or mind and have not the power of the wholehearted prayers such as these emanate from the state of fear that is the reality of the separated self "
