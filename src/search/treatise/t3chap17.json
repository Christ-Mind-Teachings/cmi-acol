    "text": " why would you ever have chosen to obscure the truth as we have already shown to have chosen to express the self in physical form was a choice consistent with the laws of love there was no need for the self to be separate in order for this to be so but there was a need for the self to have an observable form and to exist in relationship with others with observable forms this was simply so that expressions of love could be created and observed within the realm of physicality "

    "text": " the biblical story of adam and eve that has them eating from the tree of knowledge was an illustration of the effects of this observation and the judgment that sprang from it the self fell from unity through this judgment of what it observed as being other than itself through this beginning of making distinctions between the self and all other things in creation that existed with the self this is why the story of creation includes the naming of creatures it was the beginning of perception and of the idea that what was observable was other than he who did the observing now your science is proving to you the relationship between the observer and the observed the effect that one cannot help but have upon the other science still has a long way to go in determining through its processes what this says about the nature of humankind but it is closer every day to understanding the unity and interconnectedness of all things "

    "text": " as soon as spirit took on form man began to exist in time because there became a need for a beginning and an ending to the chosen experience thus each self of form is born into time and each self of form dies out of time both birth and death have always existed as choices as beginnings and endings to the finite experience of time it is the nature of what is finite to begin and end birth and death are all you have seen as true new beginnings "

    "text": " that mistake was seeing god as other than and separate from the self while it was important to the desired experience to learn the lessons of what was observable within the physical realm to have begun to forget the unobservable began a process of unlearning or forgetting of the truth that has led through the learning of untruth in the mechanism of time to the world in which you now exist it may seem ridiculous to say that the untrue can be learned but this is exactly what has been learned during the time of your experience in physical form since your true self could not learn the untrue a new self which we have called the ego self was made since the ego self cannot learn the true your true self had to be appealed to for this learning to take place "

    "text": " the holy spirit unlike god the creator has known the existence of the illusion and the thought system of the ego self and been able to communicate within that illusion without this means of communication with the ego self the ability to learn the truth could not have returned to you the time of the holy spirit has now ended because the time of illusion is now called to an end what is finite has an end point and this is that end point for the time of illusion the return of christ or your ability and willingness to live as your true self to live in the house of truth rather than the house of illusion is what will end the time of illusion just as the truth is the truth and illusion is illusion just as these things are what they are without judgment so is the beginning the beginning and the end the end the beginning we speak of here is the same as the end we speak of here the time of the holy spirit or the time in which communication was needed between the illusion and the truth must end in order for the truth to become the one reality"
