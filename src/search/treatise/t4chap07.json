    "text": " this is why all fear including the fear of death needs to be removed from you despite the radical sounding nature of life everlasting you cannot sustain christ consciousness while fear remains in you just as you cannot sustain christ consciousness while judgment remains in you why because it is not in the nature of christ it is not in the nature of the christ self to know fear or judgment what we are speaking of is abiding in your natural state your natural state is one free of fear and judgment this is all that makes up the difference between your natural state and your unnatural state as your natural state returns to you through a heart and mind joined in unity your body too will exist or abide within this natural state it cannot help but do so as it just like your heart exists in the state or reality in which you think you are the only thing that has created an unreal reality for your heart and body has been the inability of the mind to join the truth with your conscious awareness while your mind did not accept the truth of your identity or the reality of love without fear it existed in a reality of fear and judgment and bound heart and body to this reality your heart has now heard the appeal of this course and worked with your mind to bring about this acceptance of the truth a truth your heart has always known but has been unable to free you to accept without the minds cooperation "
