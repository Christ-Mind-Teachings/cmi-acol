    "text": " this idea is an idea of love it is an idea that makes perfect sense and it is its very sense that makes it seem meaningless in a world gone mad it is an idea that says only that which comes from love is real it is an idea that says only that which fits within the laws of love is reality it is an idea that says all that love would not create does not exist it is an idea that says that if you live from love and within loves laws you will create only love it is an idea that accepts that this can be done and can be done by you in the here and now to accept these ideas without accepting their ability to be applied is to change your beliefs without changing your ideas this many have done this you surely do not want to do "
