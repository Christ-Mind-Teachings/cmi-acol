    "text": " at this point groups may need to become more flexible meet less frequently or even disband in favor of former classmates meeting in more casual and spontaneous encounters it remains important for facilitators and group members to be available to one another if at all possible during this time for what is being gained through experience is still in need of being shared this sharing can offer a rich and rewarding opportunity for differences to be revealed and for the welcome realization that differences do not make separate "

    "text": " now despite the rapidity of movement or lack thereof to read the treatises together will likely feel as if it is almost a waste of valuable time thus gatherings of those working with the treatises will naturally include more sharing of experiences the facilitators task is now one of placing these experiences in context after giving the group time to talk the facilitator might choose a brief passage that will fit within the content of the sharing always it is the facilitators role to guide the individual group members away from inclinations which may be strong during this time to figure things out problem solving is to be discouraged trust is to be encouraged often a discussion can be facilitated greatly by the question how might we be able to look at this situation in a new way to encourage the gentleness of the art of thought over the relentless stridency of the thinking mind is always helpful obsessive thinking is always ruthless judgmental and wearing on the thinker he or she needs help in breaking its grip and should never be allowed to suffer "

    "text": " assisting individuals with the recognition of patterns is also a highly valuable service that facilitators and other group members can provide the entrenched patterns of the past are difficult to dislodge even when they have been recognized individuals can be encouraged here to watch the parade go by as what has gone unhealed is brought forward for acceptance forgiveness and letting go with the letting go of each old pattern or situation that seems fraught with peril a cloud of despair will lift a little more of darkness recedes and a little more light is available to show the way "

    "text": " often here the facilitator will meet as well individual assessments and self doubts group members may wonder if they are missing something they may feel as if they have not experienced unity or as if they are no closer to knowing themselves or god they may feel as if this course of study that seemed to be working so well for a while now is letting them down they may wonder where and when the peace ease and abundance promised by this course will arrive these need help in staying grounded in the present and reminders that they are no longer seeking they need your reassurance that this time of engagement with life is just what is needed to integrate what has been learned a return to the simple words that begin the treatise on unity would be appropriate a treasure that you do not as yet recognize is going to be recognized once recognized it will begin to be regarded as an ability and finally through experience it will become your identity "
