    "text": " the first thing i ask you to forget is your need to find a place where blame can be placed you who have been waiting to get to the hard part of this course may find it here the idea of blame is incongruous with the idea of a benevolent creator and a benevolent creation and as such is the only blasphemy to blame yourself is as senseless as blaming others and your inclination to place blame upon yourself must be given up as well when it is said that you are the cause it is not meant that you are to blame for anything although many a child has been blamed for his or her failure to learn blame of yourself is as uncalled for as is blaming a child for lessons yet to be learned "

    "text": " taking away the idea of placing blame will change your thought processes beyond your wildest imagining you will be surprised at how many times you recognize blame where before you saw it not just as in the beginning you did not recognize all that you had feared but just as you have from recognizing what it is you fear been able to bring those concerns to love you can now do so with blame all you need do is catch yourself in the act of placing blame and say to yourself i was placing blame again and i choose to do so no longer you need not spend any more time with blame than this and i offer you no word or sentiment to replace it i ask you simply to take the thought of it from your mind as quickly as it enters "
