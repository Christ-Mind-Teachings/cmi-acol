    "text": " some of you have had more experience with new beginnings than others for most mature adults some form of new beginning has taken place or been offered often those within the relationship of marriage have had occasion to choose to forgive the past and begin again to build a new relationship others in a similar relationship might have chosen to let the past go and enter into new relationships parents have welcomed home errant children to give them the chance to begin again at all stages of life new friendships are formed and the relationship with each new friend provides for a new beginning some begin anew through changes in locale and employment each new school year of the young provides a fresh start deaths of loved ones and the births of new family members form new configurations in a life nature begins anew each spring "

    "text": " new beginnings do not occur outside of relationship the idea of special relationship is one that hampers new beginnings special relations of all types are based upon expectation expectations of certain behavior and expectations of continued special treatment within the relationship even and sometimes especially what is considered poor behavior can come to be an expectation difficult to deviate from within the special relationship but whether the expectation is of special treatment or poor behavior matters not it is the expectation of a known set of criteria concerning the relationship a set of criteria based upon the past that is most often what prevents new beginnings from truly being new"
