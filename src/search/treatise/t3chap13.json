    "text": " we proceed by further defining the temptations of the human experience in a treatise on the art of thought we spoke of these temptations in regards to extremes of the human experience saying that these things that draw you from the peace of god draw you from the state in which you are aware of who you are and so cause you to be aware only of a self of human experience or a personal self while you may still feel a connection to god during such times you will not be dwelling within the peace of god your self and god will be but memories to you while your reality remains that of the physical experience and the personal self in such times you can conceive only of a god outside of yourself and trust not in the benevolence of the experience whether it be an extreme experience of pain or of pleasure you begin to fear that pleasure will end or that pain will not end once fear has entered doubt and guilt are never far behind "

    "text": " notice that the simple examples i gave were examples of action ideas can certainly be birthed without the need for action but one of the factors that distinguishes an idea from a belief is a requirement of action that action while not necessarily physical is the action of giving birth realize that you believe in many things that did not originate with yourself but it is not until you have your own ideas about those beliefs that you own those beliefs in terms of making them your beliefs to believe without forming your own ideas about your beliefs is to be in danger of succumbing to false beliefs "
