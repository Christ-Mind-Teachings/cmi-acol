    "text": " we also now link observance and ideas ideas form in the mind you are used to thinking that what you observe forms outside of your mind this is the thinking of the ego thought system the thought system of the truth realizes that the external world is but a reflection of the internal world thus you can observe with your eyes closed as easily as you can observe with your eyes open you can observe by having an idea of anothers health abundance peace and happiness you can observe this within yourself because it exists within your self what exists within you is shared by all this is the relationship of the truth that unites all things and that must now become observable"
