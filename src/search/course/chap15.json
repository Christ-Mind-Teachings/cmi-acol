    "text": " your concept of loyalty is what makes it difficult for you to entertain withdrawing your effort to manifest the specialness of others and yourself making special seems to be a responsibility you have undertaken and a refusal to make special an act of disloyalty whats more when all is said and done you are loyal not only to your group but to humanity itself despite the many ills that have made you and those you love suffer to call into question humanitys right to specialness seems the ultimate act of disloyalty to your own kind to even think that you could change and be unlike others of your kind you would call an act of treachery to give your allegiance to your father and to the learning goals this course has set is but an act of treason upon the world as you know it "
