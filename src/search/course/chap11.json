    "text": " the exercises in this course of love are few and they are contained within the course itself rather than separated from it there are but a few reasons for this method the first is your attitude toward instruction and the fact that you do not really desire it what you desire is what cannot be given from anywhere but your own source again you realize this aspect of creation and it has helped to solidify your stance against union and your lack of desire for instruction this is due to your confusion about your source all of your fierce determination to hang on to your individuality stems from this confusion if your source were truly your body and the brain that causes it to function then you would indeed be required to learn things on your own for all true learning must come from your source "

    "text": " you think your source and your creator are two separate things and too seldom remember even that you are not your own creator you have made this separation based on the idea that what created you cannot be one with you again this only points to your lack of recognition of what creation really is and yet when you would practice creativity you realize it is a celebration of the creator and when you honor artists of all kinds you honor but this fact every poem bears the mark of its creator as does each work of art you would gaze upon and call a masterpiece as well as those creations of little hands you hang on refrigerator doors or office walls you did not create your self and yet you make of life a recreation of yourself and in so doing try to prove that you are your own source "

    "text": " this is one reason you do not like the idea that those who would instruct you know more than you now know and why you begin each new course of learning by feeling as if you have less you then begin your attempts to acquire what you lack so that you no longer have less than anyone else some of you may be confident in your learning skills and rush in to conquer this new territory as you have others that have come before these would read each book as quickly as they can with highlighter in tow and when they have turned the last page be done with learning what this book would have to teach and rush on to the next those of you less confident may quit before you begin in order to keep from failing one more time even those who feel the power of these words within their hearts and vow to go slowly and carefully through each page and section giving total dedication to what this text would have them do are at risk of trying too hard to be earnest rather than simply desiring to learn "
