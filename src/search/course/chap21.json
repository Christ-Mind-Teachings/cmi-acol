    "text": " love is eternal and you do not as yet grasp its meaning or the meaning of eternity this is because as a particular being you are time bound you can realize the eternal even in your temporary form if you can let go of your particularity particularity has to do with mass substance form your being is far beyond your imagined reliance on the particular the particular is about parts and parts are all you see i remind you of what was said earlier concerning relationships existing apart from particulars i repeat that relationship exists between one thing and another and that it is in the intersection of parts that the holiness of what is in between is found this will be discussed in more detail later but for now i return you through the embrace to the holy relationship but in a broadened form"

    "text": " the holy relationship in its broadened form is eternity the eternity of the embrace if the embrace is the source of all the one heartbeat then it is eternity itself it is the face of love its texture taste and feel it is love conceptualized it is an abstract rather than a particular concept even while having a seeming structure that your heart can feel concepts that cannot be felt with your heart are of no use to you now for they are meant for their usefulness rather than for their service concepts that touch your heart serve you through this touch they also begin to help break you away from the need for comparisons for there is no need to compare what your heart can feel when your heart can feel you need no judgment to tell you the difference between one thing and another you thus can begin to quit relying on your bodys eyes to distinguish the true from the false the real from the unreal "

    "text": " there has been a division between the language of your mind and heart your mind insists on thinking and learning in a certain way a way contrary to the language of your heart and so like two people from different countries speaking different languages there has been little communication and much misunderstanding occasionally the problems associated with a lack of a common language have been set aside when the actions needed in a certain circumstance have demanded cooperation you see this in times of emergency or crisis of every kind and like the two people from different countries who do not understand each other working together momentarily diminishes the boundaries of language and a temporary solidarity is formed through like action at such times two strangers who are foreign to one another might recognize that the others heart is in the right place the right place with two people as with mind and heart is the place of no division the unification of mind and heart that produces right action currently occurs primarily in crisis situations because of a lack of shared language the formation of a shared language can thus be seen to aid in unification "

    "text": " conflict between mind and heart occurs for an additional reason as well although this conflict has at its root the problem of language as determined by perception this is a problem of meaning mind and heart interpret meaning in different ways you do not even begin to understand the enormity of this conflict or what it means to you but i assure you that as long as mind and heart interpret meaning in different ways you will not find peace you have in the past accepted these different interpretations as natural you see that there are two ways of viewing a situation even if you do not label one way of viewing or perceiving being of the mind and the other of the heart and you accept this conflict inducing situation you accept that your mind sees one truth and your heart another and you act anyway you act without agreement or resolution you act without unity and just as if you were two people acting on different truths in the same situation conflict cannot help but continue no matter which path you follow the path of the mind or the path of the heart you will not get where you are wanting to go until they are joined you might imagine three paths one path representing mind one path representing heart and one path representing wholeheartedness the path of neither mind nor heart alone will take you where the path of unity will take you and the journey will not be the same "

    "text": " the major cause of the conflict that arises between mind and heart is the perception of internal and external differences in meaning in extreme instances this is considered moral conflict an example being the individual knowing the right thing to do but acting instead on what is the accepted thing to do within his or her community in such an instance the external and internal meanings of the same situation are considered to be different this is fairly easy to see in extreme circumstances but it is a situation that exists constantly and in every instance until unity is achieved until unity is achieved you do not understand that you give meaning to all things and that there is nothing and no one external to you who can determine meaning for you "

    "text": " the final thing you must understand is that meaning does not change while only you can determine meaning and while only a wholehearted approach will determine true meaning the truth is the truth and does not change only unity however allows you to see the truth and to claim it as your discovery and your truth as well as universal truth seeing the truth returns you to unity and to true communication or communion with your brothers and sisters in christ your brothers and sisters in christ is an expression that has always been meant to symbolize the unity of those who know the one truth"
