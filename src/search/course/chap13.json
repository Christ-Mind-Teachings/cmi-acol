    "text": " you will soon find that what you recall of spirit is love you will want to give it many names at first and might not even recognize it as love for it will come without all the longing and sadness you so often associate with it while the feeling of love that washes over you from one may feel like courage and from another like gentleness and while this is all part of what you are encouraged to feel it is simply asked that you let the feelings come and with them the realization that while no two spirits will seem exactly the same they also are not different the love from each will fill you with happiness because it is already complete and has no needs and so no sense of longing or sadness of any kind because it is complete it will ask nothing of you but will seem to offer you a warm welcome as if you are a long lost friend returning home "
