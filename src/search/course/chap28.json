    "text": " trust and bearing witness go together as the validation sought through bearing witness is a symptom of distrust few are chosen to be prophets and the plethora of testimony taking place is brought about by innocence more so than by wisdom this sharing of personal testimony has reached its zenith and will no longer be as welcomed or appreciated so even were the intent of this course to bring testimony together in such a way as to cause an evolutionary step it would not work thus we must concentrate on wisdom the wisdom of the heart "
