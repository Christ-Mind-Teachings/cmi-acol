    "text": " you think that in order to share you must be able to speak the same language and so you regress to the language of the mind with its precision the mind so hates to be confused to be open to remain open and to not know it desires anchors to hold it in one spot and held there suffers the pounding of the sea of change resists the current fortifies itself against the storm the mind will return always to where it feels safe and sure of itself and so it goes nowhere and sees not transformation or creation or the new horizon that would defy its reality"
