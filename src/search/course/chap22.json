    "text": " in contrast the layered approach to intersection causes you to feel as if external forces are bombarding you these forces must pass through one or another of your five senses which you might think of collectively as layers and are allowed no other access these forces must then be directed often great effort is expended keeping these forces from piercing your heart the center of yourself you instead deflect them using your mind which might be considered another layer to send them to various compartments or continuing with the onion theme to one of the various layers of yourself these layers protect your heart and a great percentage of them are involved with denial with creating places where things enter and simply sit these things are not really things but are all that you have found no meaning for since your function is seen as assigning meaning rather than receiving meaning that which you consider meaningless sits and that which you consider beyond meaning sits you might imagine yourself as the creator of an unfinished dictionary and all that is sitting as that to which you have determined you will at some later date get around to assigning meaning "
