    "text": " i would suggest beginning this exploration with simple questions posed during the course of your normal life questions such as what might this situation look like if i forgot everything i have previously known about similar situations and looked at this in a new way questions such as do i really need to worry about this situation or can i affect this situation simply by not worrying about it and allowing it to be and unfold as it will questions such as while i realize that the facts would tell me this or that is true i wonder what would happen if i disregarded the facts and was open to this being something else these questions could be asked in situations as commonplace as balancing the checkbook or as momentous as a doctors diagnosis of a disease these questions could be asked when decision making seems to be called for and when plans seem to need to be made "
