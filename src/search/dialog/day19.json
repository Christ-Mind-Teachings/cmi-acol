    "text": " those of you who are the forerunners of the way of mary may have felt confusion over your sense of calling you know you are called to something and something important but it does not have a form within your mind and so you see not how it can become manifest in the world in other words you know not what to do you perhaps see no specific accomplishment in your future but see instead a way of living as the ultimate accomplishment you see living as who you are in the world as the accomplishment that is needed from you and yet at times you compare yourselves to those who are able to live as who they are in the world and accomplish certain functions within the world you perhaps feel function less and purposeless at times while at other times you feel as if you are being exactly as you are meant to be "
