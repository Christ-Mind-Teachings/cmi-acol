    "text": " first we will look at the concept of god as supreme being god as one being one entity when thought of in such a way it is somewhat easier to relate to god than when god is thought of in broader terms you might think of god as you think of yourself when thinking of the ideas put forth here you might think of god deciding to know himself you might think of god deciding to create you might think of god creating you might think of god granting free will to his creations then perhaps you might think of god resting or standing back and witnessing the unfolding of all that he created "

    "text": " another concept of god is that of creator this concept might have nothing to do with the notion of god wanting to know himself this concept may be quite amorphous and not tremendously different than scientific notions of the source of life whether it be called god or the big bang or evolution this notion presents the concept of something being begun and then turned loose proceeding from its beginnings under scientific or natural laws "

    "text": " another idea of god within the concept of a creator god is of god existing in all of what has been created god is within this concept seen as the spirit within all that lives and also seen as an overriding spirit a force a unifying factor god is closer within this idea to being a participatory being but still falls short man lives and has free will animals abide by the laws of nature god is still a concept "
