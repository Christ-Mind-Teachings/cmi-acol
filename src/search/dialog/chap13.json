    "text": " what is known to you in an instant through the new means available to you within the state of unity will still seem at times to need to be learned anew in daily living this is knowing that will often come in a flash and is in a sense a humorous metaphor for the idea of a divine ray of light descending and granting enlightenment take another look at your bible for many stories such as these and you will read account after account of people who did not know how to live with what they came to know with what was received in a ray of light from within the state of unity "

    "text": " you will know that this knowing must be shared and yet you will not at first fully realize that this sharing is not needed so much as a means of imparting important knowledge to others but so that you can come to understand it what comes of union is a knowing that exists in relationship once you have attained a state of being able to sustain christ consciousness this will no longer be a problem because you will constantly abide in awareness of the relationship of unity but until this state is achieved you will move in and out of states of awareness of the relationship of unity "

    "text": " we come now to the second part of what we are exploring together here the idea that what you come to know may literally not be sharable with those who remain in a separate state except through the sharing of who you are and who you know others to be all this means is that while you may feel unable to share or express all that comes to you from unity and while you may feel unable to share or express the authority and truth you know it represents you will by living according to what you know to be the truth form the very relationships and union that will allow the truth to be shared the relationship or union in other words precedes the sharing of what can only be given and received in relationship "

    "text": " this is why you were told specifically not to evangelize or attempt to convince these are actions of the separated self attempting to fulfill intermediary functions relationship or union is what negates the need for such intermediary functions by being who you are and seeing others as who they truly are you create the relationship in which sharing can occur without relationship there is no willingness and no union without relationship you behave as a separated self attempting to communicate union from the state of separation this does not work join with your brother and sister in christ however and sharing becomes effortless and joyful and effective cause and effect become one means and end the same"
