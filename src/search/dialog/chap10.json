    "text": " learning is about the transfer of knowledge that was gained in the time of learning through the process of learning notice the inability of teaching or learning to call forth talents ideas imagination inspiration instinct intuition vision or calling you may believe that teaching and learning appropriately work with and enable the use of abilities such as these but you also know that these means are limited in what they can do and that they can hinder as well as enhance the creative expression of these givens "

    "text": " now you might be thinking here that while these givens come from the realm of unity your expression of these givens since that expression exists in the realm of time and space and involves the work and time of your form in your forms separate reality is not of union but of the individual self you may feel that to think of this in any other way will leave you with no individual personal accomplishment nothing to be proud of nothing to call your own you thus must begin to realize that the bringing forth of the accomplishment that already exists in unity is your new work the work of the self of union the work that can fill you with the true joy of true accomplishment because it is your real work work with what is"

    "text": " working with what is in unity is not work but relationship you are called to realize your relationship with what is given from unity it is in that relationship the relationship between what is and the expression of what is by the elevated self of form that the new is created what is becomes new by becoming sharable in form or in other words what is continues to become through the continuation of relationship and the creation of new relationships in this way sharing in relationship becomes the goal and the accomplishment of the elevated self of form the means through which the self of union is known even in the realm of separation and thus what draws others from separation to union "

    "text": " the goal and relationship of the elevated self of form is thus timeless for it draws from the realm of unity and returns to the realm of unity this is an expression of the biblical injunction to go forth and multiply it is about increase to be content with personal or individual understanding or experience of what is given is to not complete the cycle of giving and receiving as one what is given must be received what is received must be given this is the way of increase and multiplication this is the way of creation"
