    "text": " one of the primary ideas that will assist you in leaving patterns of thinking behind is the idea that thought as we are describing it the thought that is not really thought but the way of coming to know of the self joined in unity enters you through the place of mind and heart joined in wholeheartedness at the center of yourself a place that has nothing to do with the body that you listen hear and respond may at times be of the body but it may also at times not be of the body the main idea to hold in your mind and heart is the idea of entry and the idea that what comes of unity does not need access through your bodys eyes or ears or any of what you consider to be your senses along with this main idea it is essential for you to realize that this is not so strange and unusual as it may sound that this access and entryway already exists within you and that you have already benefited from moments of interaction with if not awareness of the state of unity "
