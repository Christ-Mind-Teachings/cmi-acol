    "text": " you must realize here that the pattern of learning is now all that is left that can be degenerating to you while you always were supported the idea of learning that you accepted during the time of learning was not one of support but one of effort you must accept now that the pattern of learning is an extension of fear and be willing and vigilant in replacing it with a pattern of acceptance i say this because so many of you still do not feel supported in your daily life you may feel supported in your spiritual life in your progress toward full awareness and the elevation of the self of form but as in the discussion of abundance you may still feel unsupported in form realize now that this makes no sense when our goal is the elevation of form if for no other reason begin to accept this support of form because it makes sense it is logical and realize further that love is not opposed to logic but returns true reason to the mind and heart "

    "text": " another condition of the time of acceptance that will be of great service to you now is that of the different relationship that you will have with time this is a time of convergence intersection and pass through of the finite and the infinite of time and no time time has not yet ceased to be but as you are in a state of transformation so too is it again i remind you as within so without as you let go of times hold on you it will let go of you time will seem to expand but will actually be contracting into nothingness time is replaced by presence by your ability to exist in the here and now in acceptance and without fear "

    "text": " a further condition of the time of acceptance is that of expansion the singular self you once believed yourself to be was not capable of true expansion and true sharing the singular self withdrew into its own little world and created its own universe the elevated self of form will expand into the world and create a new universe this condition of expansion is operative now and beginning to find manifestation through the sharing we are doing here "

    "text": " there are many lesser conditions that are nonetheless extremely transformative such as the replacement of special relationship with the devotion of holy relationship that we have already spoken of another replacement is that of control with grace this occurs as you give up the control you have but thought you exerted over your life and its circumstances and live in a state of grace meeting grace with grace by accepting what is given for your regeneration "
