    "text": " the degree of your separation from wholeness can be seen much as the degree of separation between hot and cold if you were to perceive of wholeness as an ideal temperature you might think for a moment just as an illustration of your experience of separation always taking place at a certain number of degrees away from the ideal the temperature was thus never perfect but rather always either too hot or too cold yet the perfect temperature always existed you just did not experience it you were in other words separate from it because of the degree of separation that you chose because you never chose union or wholeness you did not experience lack of body temperature or the effects of weather but it is as if you denied your body the ideal 986 degrees internally and 78 degrees externally there is no living body that does not exhibit a temperature no environment that does not do so some kind of temperature is thus a constant a constant is an aspect of wholeness a variable is an aspect of separation the constant does not become variable because variability exists "
