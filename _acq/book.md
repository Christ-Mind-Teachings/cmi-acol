          A Course of Love is a living course that leads to the recognition, through experience, of the truth of who we really are as human and divine beings a truth much more magnificent than we previously could imagine.
          </p>

          Though it stands by itself, ACOL is complementary to A Course in Miracles. It was received by Mari Perron over three years. Like ACIM, ACOL presents itself in the Voice of Jesus. Many students of ACIM recognize the Voice.
